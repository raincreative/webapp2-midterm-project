I regret that I couldn't integrate photos into the website as originally intended. However, I've finished the three basic pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with simple text colors. Challenges arose due to personal commitments and a demanding school workload, making it hard to include photos. Nevertheless, I remain dedicated to ensuring the website fulfills your expectations in all other aspects.
